Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Rocket Lab is a small satellite provider. Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. \n\nSpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.\n\n```\nTherefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, \nwe can determine the cost of a launch.\n```\n\nA new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX.\n\n`Project Objective` is to determine the price of each launch by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards. \n\nAlso to determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. This will be done by training a machine learning model and use public information to predict if **SpaceX** will reuse the first stage."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.10", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.10.6", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
